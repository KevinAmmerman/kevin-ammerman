                The Glenfiddich distillery is a must-see for any whisky enthusiast or for anyone wanting to learn more
                about
                the production of single malt Scotch. On a tour of the distillery you can follow the entire production
                process from malting the barley to maturation in the casks. You'll gain fascinating insights into the
                traditions and craftsmanship of whisky-making.

                A highlight is visiting the warehouses where the precious whisky casks are left to mature for years.
                Glenfiddich has one of the largest stocks of maturing whisky in Scotland. The subsequent tasting lets
                you
                experience the differences between the various Glenfiddich expressions.

                Glenfiddich is also notable for its spirit of innovation. It was the first distillery to produce only
                single
                malt and to use continuous stills. To this day Glenfiddich experiments with different cask types to
                refine
                its whiskies.

                The distillery also has an excellent visitor center with a whisky shop and restaurant. Its location in
                the
                heart of Scotland's Speyside whisky region with views of the Highlands creates the perfect whisky
                experience. Glenfiddich is ideal for discovering the tradition and innovation of Scottish whisky.

                Aberlour is a historic distillery situated on the banks of the River Spey in the heart of Scotland's
                Speyside whisky region. Founded in 1879, Aberlour produces a range of rich, sherried Speyside single
                malt whiskies.

                A tour of Aberlour provides a fascinating glimpse into traditional Scottish distilling. You'll see the
                traditional mash tuns, wooden washbacks and copper stills where Aberlour's whisky is lovingly crafted. A
                highlight is visiting the distillery's warehouses with rows of maturing casks, where the warm Speyside
                air nurtures the whisky.

                During a tasting you can sample Aberlour's core range including the signature Aberlour 12 Year Old
                matured in Oloroso sherry casks. It has notes of raisin, cocoa and ginger spice. Other expressions like
                A'bunadh are aged exclusively in first-fill sherry butts for added depth.

                Beyond whisky production, Aberlour offers beautiful scenery from the walking trails along the River Spey
                to the Ben Rinnes mountain backdrop. With its tradition, setting, and quality whisky, Aberlour is a
                must-visit for any whisky fan exploring Scotland's scenic Speyside region.
