                    Aberlour A'bunadh is a cask strength single malt Scotch whisky produced by Aberlour Distillery in
                    Speyside, Scotland. It is an unchillfiltered and non-colored whisky bottled at cask strength,
                    typically between 115-130 proof.
                    <br>
                    A'bunadh, meaning "the original" in Gaelic, is matured exclusively in hand-picked Oloroso sherry
                    butts. This imparts rich flavors of dried fruits, orange peel, chocolate and spices. On the palate,
                    A'bunadh is bold and potent with a velvety mouthfeel. It has layers of sherried fruit, toasted oak,
                    vanilla and a hint of peat smoke.
                    <br>
                    As a cask strength whisky, each batch of A'bunadh varies in proof and flavor nuances depending on
                    the casks selected. These unique characteristics along with its lack of chill filtration make
                    A'bunadh a favorite among whisky enthusiasts seeking an intense, old-school sherry bomb.
